Dear reader,
This is a repository consisting of the projects conducted by me with the assisstance of my teachers at the Google Cybersecurity Course on Coursera.
This portfolio will consist of projects that include but is not limited to: Python programming, Structured query language (SQL), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, the use of Linux operating system, and conducting internal security audits.
There are eight domains within the Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP) under The International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2). During my induction of this project, I will be carefully surveying and determing which of the eight domains closely resembles my interest and passion for cybersecurity. Currently I am interested in Security Architecture and Engineering, Communication and Network Security, Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Security Operations.
